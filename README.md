# Meetups for the non-committal WDI student

Oh, there are a lot of technical Meetups out there.  How can you paw through them all and remember what you might be interested in but not actually RSVP to the meetup?  Maybe you would just like to be reminded about it as it gets closer and THEN you can decide whether or not to sign up.

No worries, this app solves your committal problems.

We will paw through the Meetup.com technical meetups and let you choose which ones you are interested in - without having to sign up!  Then we will remind you as the date of the Meetup approaches and THEN you can decide whether or not to JOIN SOMETHING.
